/*
  trans_wipe_left.js — Horizontal Wipe (reveal sweeps right -> left)
  Spatial wipe across x axis with feathered edge: the new pattern is
  uncovered starting at x=1 and the boundary travels leftward as
  `progress` ramps 0 -> 1.

  Pixel-perfect endpoints — see trans_wipe_right.js docstring for the
  bias rationale.
  Uses transition built-ins: progress, fromR/G/B/W/A/U, toR/G/B/W/A/U
